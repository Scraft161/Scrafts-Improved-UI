# Scraft's Improved UI
UI improvements aimed at casual minecraft players and professionals providing various improvements for everyone.

## Editions
Scraft's Improved UI comes in 3 editions

- Minimal -> Only show outlines
- Light   -> Light-themed transparent background
- Dark    -> Dark-themed transparent background

Light and dark edtitions use transparency-based pixel blending and may cause extra lag on old/weak graphics cards

## Installation
copy (or symlink if you know how) the pacs you want to your resource pack folder.

locations:
Windows:
```
c:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\appdata\roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks
```
NOTE: you may want to type `%appdata%` to navigate there as `appdata` is a hidden folder

Linux:
```
/home/[YOUR USERNAME]/.minecraft
```
NOTE: Linux hides files and folders starting with `.`, you may want to enable hidden files and folders

OSX:
I do not know the location for OSX, if you do know please let me know

BSD:
If you use BSD you're smart enough to figure it out yourself

Plan-9:
Wait, plan-9 runs minecraft?

TempleOS:
Now you're just spewing BS.
